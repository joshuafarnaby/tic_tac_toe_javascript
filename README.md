# ticTacToe

A Tic-Tac-Toe game which can be played in the browser

The objective of this assignment is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe using objects. Where previous assigments would utilise prototypal inheritance models (using ES5 Constructors), this assignment has the aim of building the app using fuctional programming techniques such as Factory Functions, IIFE's, the module pattern, and favouring 'composition over inheritance'. A broad target of this assignemnt is to reduce the amount of global code within the program.

The style of the tokens, particularly the hover effects, is borrowed from WebDevSimplified's Tic-Tac-Toe game. Using the :before and :after selectors to create the tokens is not something I would have considered without watching the corresponding tutorial. If you are learning Web Development then I cannot recommend his Youtube Channel enough - go check it out!
